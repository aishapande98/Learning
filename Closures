Closures are bulit-in to Javascript
If the fuction is returned then it will be removed from Global execution context.
However, in closure inner function can access properties and variables of outer function even if the parent function is returned.
Below is the example of Closure in Javascript,


function retirement(retirementAge){


    return function (YearOfBirth){
        var Age=2020-YearOfBirth;
        console.log((retirementAge-Age));
    }
}
var retirementUs=retirement(66);
retirementUs(1998);
